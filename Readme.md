## Type everything

Run all commands at project root.

### Dependencies
```
$ npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader source-map-loader
$ npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
```

1. `typescript`: the TypeScript compiler

2. `ts-loader`. Helps Webpack compile your TypeScript code using TypeScript 
configuration file `tsconfig.json`.

3. `source-map-loader`: Uses sourcemap output (if any) from TypeScript compiler
to be used by Webpack when generating its own sourcemaps. Ultimately, JS code is
run, and JS code is the bit that fails and crashes. Source map allows tools to 
map the error line in JS code (generated by TypeScript compiler or Webpack) to 
your actual source code in TypeScript (or even JS).

4. `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`: type definition files for React. These
are published by library authors.

You already have `webpack` and `webpack-cli` otherwise would have added those
too.

### TypeScript Configuration
```
$ touch tsconfig.json
```

TypeScript compiler settings are defined in `tsconfig.json` file. There are
many options, but I only added the bare minimum:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "jsx": "react"
  }
}
```

### Webpack Configuration

See `webpack.config.js`.
